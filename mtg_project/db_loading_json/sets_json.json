The damage to the planar fabric at Tolaria was so severe that it couldn't be healed — not in the present day. The heroes seek out the planeswalker Karn, the only being ever to travel through time. To heal Tolaria’s rift, Karn uses the full extent of his planeswalking power to enter the rift and return to the past, to the moment before the archwizard Barrin cast a spell that obliterated countless Phyrexians and himself. Karn succeeds and seals the planar rift before Barrin’s actions can rip it open. In the next moment, Karn is lost.

The cards also feature a new futuristic card frame to hint at potential changes to the layout of Magic cards and to denote which cards are actually timeshifted.
